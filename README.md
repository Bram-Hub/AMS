## About
YAMS is an abacus machine simulator program. You can create, edit, save, and then later load your abacus machine. Simulating features are also provided.
There is a help menu in the PEAS window that I recommend you read, since many action have short cuts that may not appear obvious. For example you can drag around the work area by dragging with the middle mouse button, or zoom by scrolling with the mouse. 
This program is distributed under the GNU GPL, which pretty much means that 1) it might not work and 2) if you redistribute it, make sure you provide the source.
